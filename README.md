# Age of the Abalone - a regression mission
I haven't messed around with a lot of machine learning algorithms for a while so in this project I'll be testing a few different algorithms to see how well they can predict the age of an abalone depending on 8 features:

1. Sex - Sex (M: Male, F: Female, I: Infant)
2. Length - Longest Shell measurement (millimeters - mm)
3. Diameter - perpendicular to length (mm)
4. Height - with meat in shell (mm)
5. Whole weight - whole abalone (grams)
6. Shucked weight - Weight of meat (grams)
7. Viscera weight - Gut weight after bleeding (grams)
8. Shell weight - Shell weight after being dried (grams)

The 9th column represents the rings of the abalone which is equal to the age of the abalone minus 1.5. So 10 rings means it is 11.5 years old.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The first step is to explore our data, this can be followed along in the abalone_regression notebook.
